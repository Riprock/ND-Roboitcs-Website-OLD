                <h3>The Robot</h3>
                <p>Small but mighty.  That's the principle behind the Robotic Knights.  This machine is an amazing feat of VEX Robotics engineering.  Designed with the core idea of simplicity, its complexity shows in its stellar performance.  The Robotic Knights is our fastest machine, with the ability to start, stop, and turn in the blink of an eye.  Its shooter features amazing mid-distance accuracy, which is no match for its competition.</p>
				<hr />
				<h3>The Team</h3>
				<p>The Robotic Knights is created by two main engineers, Andy and Ben.  This robot was designed, constructed, and reconstructed multiple times, greatly fine-tuning its strengths.  Programming the Robotic Knights is Thomas, who also assists with the building process.  This bot is also built by Steven, Dominic, Matt, Tyler, and Sai.</p>
