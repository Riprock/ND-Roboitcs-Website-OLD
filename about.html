                <p>Founded in 2014, the Notre Dame West Haven robotics team is entering its second season.  Since our inception, the team has immensely grown, from several members- now to about 15 dedicated members.  This year, we have designed, built, and programmed three premier robots to compete in the 2016 VEX Robotics Nothing But Net Challenge.</p>
                <p>Our team is headed up by some amazing people, who greatly contribute to the STEM education aspects of the club.  Primarily headed up by Mrs. Saxon, our school's physics teacher.  Mrs. Saxon manages the entire team- from event schedules, to transportation organization, always keeping everybody excited for robotics.  Alongside Mrs. Saxon is this year's lead engineer, Terry.  Terry leads the Green Machine, and sets our entire club on the right path towards engineering success.  Without these two dedicated people, our team would not be as prepared for success as it is today.</p>
                <p>For more information on our school, the spirit of the club, and what it means to be a Notre Dame student, please be sure to check out our school's website, <a href="http://notredamehs.com" target="_blank">notredamehs.com</a>.</p>
