                <h3>The Robot</h3>
                <p>Th_ is the powerhouse robot, huge in size and in performance.  Never failing to surpass expectations, Th_ features a very impressive shooter.  With a huge gear ratio and precise measurements, this bot features insane accuracy from long distances. Unlike most bots, Th_ is not just a shooter.  It also features a complete lift, pushing functionality, and a very accurate autonomous system.  Th_ is extremely reliable, and is not an easy win against its competitors.</p>
				<hr />
				<h3>The Team</h3>
				<p>Th_ has been created by a small, yet mighty team.  Headed up by Anish & Shaun as the lead engineers, its design is like no other. This bot has been programmed by Michael, who also assists in the construction of the machine.  Also contributing great efforts in the build team are Matt & Alex, who have helped greatly in bringing Th_ to life.</p>
